**Project Title:**  Email Spam Detection

**Project Description:**

This project aims to develop a model to detect spam emails. The model is trained on a dataset of spam and ham emails, and uses a Naive Bayes classifier to predict whether a new email is spam or ham.

**Motivation:**

Spam emails are a major nuisance, and can often be dangerous. They can contain viruses, malware, and phishing scams. By developing a model to detect spam emails, we can help people to protect themselves from these threats.

**Dataset:**

The dataset used to train the model is the SMS Spam Collection dataset, which contains over 5,500 spam and ham emails. The emails have been pre-processed to remove stop words and punctuation, and to convert all text to lowercase.

**Model:**

The model used to detect spam emails is a Naive Bayes classifier. Naive Bayes classifiers are a type of machine learning algorithm that are well-suited for text classification tasks. The Naive Bayes classifier works by learning the probability of each word occurring in a spam email or a ham email. Once the model has been trained, it can use this information to predict the probability of a new email being spam or ham.

**Usage:**

To use the model, simply pass the text of the email to the predict() method. The method will return a prediction of whether the email is spam or ham.

**Evaluation:**

The model was evaluated on a test set of 1,500 spam and ham emails. The model achieved an accuracy of 98% on the test set.

**Conclusion:**

This project has demonstrated that it is possible to develop a highly accurate model to detect spam emails using a Naive Bayes classifier. The model can be used to protect people from spam emails and other threats.
